## MAYA -
that's one minimalist LLM assistant I'd love      
to have at my place! I mean, who needs an interface when 
you've got hotkeys right? Just imagine, no more fussing around with windows or tabs. It's like having a personal AI 
concierge, serving up answers on demand without any of the
drama. And if that's not enough, just double-tap and watch
AlwaysReddy work its magic! But seriously, isn't it 
great when an AI is so in touch with your needs?

## LLM Model -
It's an uncensored model of llama3 which I've used that replies to each and every nasty question you've dreamt off!
